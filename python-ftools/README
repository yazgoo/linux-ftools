What is this anyway?
--------------------
Python ftools implements some useful system calls for use in Python programs.
The mincore system call (called fincore and fincore_ratio in Python ftools)
tells you how many pages of a file are in filesystem page-cache.
The fadvise system call can manipulate filesystem page-cache for a given file.

fincore and fincore_ratio take a file descriptor as the argument;
For instance:
fd = file(sys.argv[1], 'r')

pages_cached, pages_total = ftools.fincore_ratio(fd.fileno())

and

vector = fincore.fincore(fd.fileno())
for page in vector:
    if ord(page) & 0x01:
        pages_cached += 1
pages_total = len(vec)


Build Python ftools library:
----------------------------
build:
    python setup.py build

If you do not install the Python ftools library system wide then
make sure it is in your PYTHONPATH like this:

    PYTHONPATH=build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.5/ ./fincore setup.py



Useful utility programs: fincore and fadvise
--------------------------------------------

Usage: fincore [options]

Determine how much of a file is in filesystem page-cache.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory=DIRECTORY
                        Recursively descend into a directory


Usage: fadvise [options]

Advise the Linux kernel to manipulate filesystem page cache for files or
directories

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m MODE, --mode=MODE  The modes are: normal - No special treatment. random -
                        Expect page references in random order. sequential -
                        Expect page references in sequential order. willneed -
                        Expect access in the near future. dontneed - Do not
                        expect access in the near future. Subsequent access of
                        pages in this range will succeed, but will result
                        either in reloading of the memory contents from the
                        underlying mapped file or zero-fill-in-demand pages
                        for mappings without an underlying file. noreuse -
                        NOTE: This mode is currently a no-op! Access data only
                        once.
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory=DIRECTORY
                        Recursively descend into a directory

Why are some of cached sizes in my above example bigger than the file size?
It should be obvious; the page size on this machine is 4096 bytes.


fadvise example usage:

Perhaps your mysql database doesn't leverage the Innodb buffer pool for caching but instead relies
on the filesystem page cache. If you could use this to warm up the cold database if the dataset is small
enough to fit into memory :

./fadvise -m willneed /var/lib/mysql

Or perhaps you'd like to warm up certain Column Families on your Cassandra node:
./fadvise -m willneed /mnt/var/cassandra/data/fu/Items-*
